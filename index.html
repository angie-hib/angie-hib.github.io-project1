            <h5>Quoted from Wikipedia:</h5>
            <blockquote>Alexandre Dumas born Dumas Davy de la Pailleterie (24 July 1802 – 5 December 1870), also known as Alexandre Dumas père (where père is French for 'father', thus 'the elder/senior'), was a French writer. His works have been translated into many languages, and he is one of the most widely read French authors. Many of his historical novels of high adventure were originally published as serials, including The Count of Monte Cristo, The Three Musketeers, Twenty Years After, and The Vicomte of Bragelonne: Ten Years Later. His novels have been adapted since the early twentieth century into nearly 200 films.<sup><a href="#dumas_ref">[1]</a></sup></blockquote>

            <h5>Quoted from Wikipedia:</h5>
            <blockquote>Gustave Flaubert (12 December 1821 – 8 May 1880) was a French novelist. Highly influential, he has been considered the leading exponent of literary realism in his country. According to the literary theorist Kornelije Kvas, "in Flaubert, realism strives for formal perfection, so the presentation of reality tends to be neutral, emphasizing the values and importance of style as an objective method of presenting reality". He is known especially for his debut novel Madame Bovary (1857), his Correspondence, and his scrupulous devotion to his style and aesthetics. The celebrated short story writer Guy de Maupassant was a protégé of Flaubert.<sup><a href="#flaubert_ref">[2]</a></sup></blockquote>

            <blockquote>Victor Marie Hugo (26 February 1802 – 22 May 1885) was a French poet, novelist, and dramatist of the Romantic movement.

            <h5>Quoted from Wikipedia, translated from Swedish to English:</h5>
            <blockquote>Jon Olof Åberg, born July 2, 1843 in Ås parish, Öland, died May 20, 1898 in Stockholm, was a Swedish author. He was the son of the contract rector in Förlösa Olaus Åberg and Anna Maria Bonell. After a short schooling, he began writing novels and short stories. Since he moved to Stockholm in the 1860s, he published a large number of popularly held descriptions of smaller scope, mainly with action from Swedish history. Through simple language and an ability to use suspense elements, his writing became successful.<sup><a href="#aberg_ref">[4]</a></sup></blockquote>

            <h5>Quoted from Wikipedia, translated from Finnish to English:</h5>
            <blockquote>Johannes Alfthan (July 4, 1830 Vyborg - October 20, 1893 Stockholm) was a Finnish journalist, book publisher and author who wrote in Swedish. He released most of his production in Sweden. Alfthan's parents were the Vyborg Wholesaler and Candle Maker, Governor Secretary Anton Alfthan and Helena Schroeder. He attended Vyborg High School and became a student in 1847. Alfthan was expelled from the University of Helsinki after presenting ideas that were too liberal for the authorities in the aftermath of the mad 1848 of Europe. He moved to Vyborg, became a bookseller and publisher in 1851, and published Wiborg magazine in 1855-1860. However, the transactions did not go as expected and so Alfthan eventually sold his printing house, bookstore and newspaper. He settled with his family to inherit his wife's inheritance at Vahvaniemi's house.<sup><a href="#alfthan_ref">[5]</a></sup></blockquote>

            <h5>Quoted from Wikipedia:</h5>
            <blockquote>Born in Grangärde parish in the province of Dalarna, Andersson grew up under harsh conditions in the village of Skattlösberg. His father Adolf was a primary school teacher there, and his mother Augusta had also taught in the local school. The village lies in the "Finn Woods" of southern Dalarna, where Forest Finns had immigrated to cultivate new land. On his father's side, Andersson descended from these Finnish settlers. Andersson took odd jobs during the first years of his life, for instance as a forestry worker and school teacher. He found it difficult to make a living. The family considered trying to find a better life in the United States, and Andersson was sent to live in Forest Lake, Minnesota as a 14-year-old in 1902 to see if it would be possible.<sup><a href="#andersson_ref">[6]</a></sup></blockquote>

            <h5>Quoted from Wikipedia</h5>
            <blockquote>Franz Kafka (3 July 1883 – 3 June 1924) was a German-speaking Bohemian novelist and short-story writer, widely regarded as one of the major figures of 20th-century literature. His work fuses elements of realism and the fantastic. It typically features isolated protagonists facing bizarre or surrealistic predicaments and incomprehensible socio-bureaucratic powers. It has been interpreted as exploring themes of alienation, existential anxiety, guilt, and absurdity. His best known works include "Die Verwandlung" ("The Metamorphosis"), Der Process (The Trial), and Das Schloss (The Castle). The term Kafkaesque has entered the English language to describe situations like those found in his writing.<sup><a href="#kafka_ref">[9]</a></sup></blockquote>

            <h5>Quoted from Wikipedia</h5>
            <blockquote>Jane Austen (16 December 1775 – 18 July 1817) was an English novelist known primarily for her six major novels, which interpret, critique and comment upon the British landed gentry at the end of the 18th century. Austen's plots often explore the dependence of women on marriage in the pursuit of favourable social standing and economic security. Her works critique the novels of sensibility of the second half of the 18th century and are part of the transition to 19th-century literary realism. Her use of biting irony, along with her realism, humour, and social commentary, have long earned her acclaim among critics, scholars, and popular audiences alike.<sup><a href="#austin_ref">[10]</a></sup></blockquote>
